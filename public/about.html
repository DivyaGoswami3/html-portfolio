<h2>About Me</h2>
<h3>My journey as a developer</h3>
<p>My name is <strong>Divya Goswami</strong>, and I am a passionate web developer with a love for creating dynamic and user-friendly websites. 
  My journey in web development began in 2025, when I first discovered the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have honed my skills and expanded my knowledge in various web technologies. I have worked on numerous projects, ranging from simple static websites to complex web applications. 
  My expertise includes front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end development with Node.js and Express.</p>
<p>In addition to my technical skills, I am also a strong advocate for web accessibility and user experience. 
  I believe that every user should have equal access to information and services on the web, 
  and I strive to create inclusive designs that cater to diverse audiences.</p>
<p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing my knowledge with the developer community.
  I am always eager to learn and grow as a developer, and I look forward to the exciting challenges that lie ahead.</p>
